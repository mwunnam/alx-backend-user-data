## Basic Regex Concepts
1. Pattern Matching: It uses a sequence of characters to form patterns, which can match combinations of characters in strings
	* `.`: Matches any character except a newline
	* `^`: Matches the start of a string
	* `$`: Matches the end of a string
	* `*`: Matches 0 or more repetitions of the preceding element
	* `+`: Matches 1 or more repetitions of a preceeding element
	* `[]`: Matches any character within the brackets eg. `[abc] matches `a` or `b` or `c`
	* `\d`: Matches any digit(0-9)
	* `w`: Matches any alphanumeric character or underscore
	* `|`: Acts as an OR e.g., `a|b` matches `a` or `b`
	* `?`: Matches 0 or 1 of the preceding token.
